    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To work through most of the levels to expand and get the most out of my computing knowledge</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I think so, as I managed to do quite a lot of the levels and some of the very complex levels and do them in multiple ways.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I tried not to do the levels the easiest/ simplest ways possible to stretch my learning I tried to do the levels multiple times but different ways.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I got confused between the left and right turns and also the spring and forward button. This made me take longer on the levels and therefore do less levels.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could take a note of what some of the turns and controls are so that I won't get confused and therefore I can do more levels to enhance my learning</td>
