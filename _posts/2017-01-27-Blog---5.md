  <tr>
    <td>I got confused between the left and right turns and also the spring and forward button. This made me take longer on the levels and therefore do less levels.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>I could take a note of what some of the turns and controls are so that I won't get confused and therefore I can do more levels to enhance my learning</td>
