    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To successfully create the infrastructure so that my Google Doc template would publish.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I think so, as I followed all the instructions and seem to have done everything in the correct order. I also managed to edit things about me and my profile picture (avatar)</td>

    <td>Listening to the teacher and the google slides helped me learn. Asking my friends helped as they described in a more simpler way and showed me if i can't find where the button or the link is. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Whilst I was trying to edit the information it wouldn't let me click on it/ let me edit so that stopped me. But then I logged out then back in and it was fine. When I had finished with my work I published it and it did not work so i tried to click on things but i just had to refresh the page.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>I got mixed up with some of the instructions so to improve i could make notes of what the order of the instructions are and i could also listen more attentively. </td>
